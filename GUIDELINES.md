# Meta-kodi recipe guidelines

## Variable naming
Introduced variables should not contain underscores as part of their name. For example **KODI_ADDONS** should be converted to **KODIADDONS** to avoid confiusion with override opeartor underscore. **KODI_ADDONS** is easier to read but we decided to use variables without underscores.
